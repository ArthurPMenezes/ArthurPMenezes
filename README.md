####  The goal of the "The Dictionary From the Programmer" is to provide a comprehensive guide for programmers of all levels, from beginners to seniors. This book was created with the aim of providing a unique and complete resource for those who are learning to program, as well as for those looking to enhance their skills. Throughout my journey as a programmer, I realized the need for a resource that brings together a large amount of relevant information in one place. I learned that the learning journey in programming can be challenging and often lonely. That's why I decided to create this book, to share my knowledge and experience, and to provide readers with a reliable and comprehensive guide.
